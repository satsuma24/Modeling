# 1. Dataset summary
The dataset comprises a training set, containing user transactions from August 1st, 2016  to April 30th, 2018 (638 days) and a test set, containing user transactions from May 1st, 2018 to October 15th 2018 (168 days).
The submission file should be forward-looking predictions of PredictedLogRevenue for each of these fullVisitorIds for the timeframe of December 1st, 2018 to January 31st, 2019 (62 days).

# 2. Training set creation

From the structure of test set, as we have 168 days (2018/05/01-2018/10/15) of sessions for customers, 62 days (2018/12/01-2019/01/31) of target calculation period and 46 days (16/10/2018-30/11/2018) of gap between above two windows. According to this special structure of prediction period, we decided to reorganize the training set by analogy to test and target set.

168-day: feature window- user features (X's)
46-day: gap
62-day: corresponding window- transaction values (y).
 
Key insights here is to use features from the first interval to predict target on the second interval.



```{r}
###function includes getting:
###*dataframe of fixed time-interval of 168 days

message("Get 1st train part")

message("Get 3rd train part")
tr3 = getTimeFramewithFeatures(tr, 3)
message("Get 4th train part")
tr4 = getTimeFramewithFeatures(tr, 4)
```

First step is to combine training and test datasets together as a new training set in total. The combined dataset covers user transactions of 806 days.

Secondly, the 806-day training dataset is split into 4 non-overlapping training subsets. The idea of breaking it into 4 sets is to set up similar time structure to prediction period, (638+ 168-46-62)/168 = 4.2, so 806 days can be split into 4 subsets in maximum.



```{r}

###Costruction of the test-set (by analogy as train-set)

  group_by(fullVisitorId) %>%
  summarize(
    channelGrouping = max(ifelse(is.na(channelGrouping) == TRUE, -9999, channelGrouping)),
    first_ses_from_the_period_start = min(date) - tr5_mindate,

    source = max(ifelse(is.na(source) == TRUE, -9999, source)),
    medium = max(ifelse(is.na(medium) == TRUE, -9999, medium)),
    isVideoAd_mean = mean(ifelse(is.na(adwordsClickInfo.isVideoAd) == TRUE, 0, 1)),
    isMobile = mean(ifelse(isMobile == TRUE, 1 , 0)),
    isTrueDirect = mean(ifelse(is.na(isTrueDirect) == TRUE, 0, 1)),
    bounce_sessions = sum(ifelse(is.na(bounces) == TRUE, 0, 1)),
    hits_sum = sum(hits),
    hits_mean = mean(hits),
    hits_min = min(hits),
    hits_max = max(hits),
    hits_median = median(hits),
    hits_sd = sd(hits),
    pageviews_sum = sum(pageviews, na.rm = TRUE),

    transactionRevenue = sum(transactionRevenue),
    transactions  = sum(transactions, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
tr5$target = NA
tr5$ret = NA
```

Thirdly, we calculated the features and for users in each period and calculated target for each user on each corresponding period then combine all 4 sets into one train set. Within each target window, we set up variable 'ret' to if the user in feature window revisits (value = 1) after 46 days or not (value = 0).

Finally, we combine all datasets prepared into a full dataset including 4 training sets and 1 prediction set covers original training (638 days), test (168 days) and target set (62 days). We define it as our master dataset.



```{r}

###Combining all pieces and converting the types
train_all = rbind(tr1,tr2,tr3,tr4,tr5)
train_all$interval_dates = as.integer(train_all$interval_dates)
train_all$last_ses_from_the_period_end = as.integer(train_all$last_ses_from_the_period_end)
train_all$first_ses_from_the_period_start = as.integer(train_all$first_ses_from_the_period_start)
for (i in c(2,8:19))
  train_all[,i] = as.numeric(as.factor(train_all[,i]))
train_all[1:10,]

###Filtering train and test from combined dataframe
train = train_all[is.na(train_all$target) == FALSE,]
test =  train_all[is.na(train_all$target) == TRUE,]
```

The master dataset is further divided into master training and master test sets. Two new columns with values, return (binary 0/1) and transaction value target (numeric, 0 for all users not revisited or revisited but no transaction occurred), were added into master training set. Our goal next step is to predict return rate and transaction value target on master test set.



The Kaggle competition notebook of modeling part:

#Intro of the Light gbm used in the competition

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

Faster training speed and higher efficiency.
Lower memory usage.
Better accuracy.
Support of parallel and GPU learning.
Capable of handling large-scale data.

#Light gbm in our use case

In our competition, we choose the lightGBM as our main machine learning model to forecast the customers' total reveune in the time window of 2018/12/01 to 2019/01/31.

Initial steps includes transforming the original training and test datasets into light gbm predefined dataset format to ensure the training process seamlessly.

```{r}
dtrain_all <- lgb.Dataset(as.matrix(train[-c(1,39,40)]),label = train$ret)
dtrain_ret <- lgb.Dataset(as.matrix(train[-c(1,39,40)][train$ret == 1,]),label = train[train$ret == 1,]$target)
pr_lgb_sum = 0
message("Training and predictions")

```

After the the dataset has been set up, let's begin our training job and predicting the reveune.

In order to forecast the total revenue of each customer, we designed and implemented a stack prediction model:

1. the first layer of it is classifier that predict whether the customer will purchase the item or not.

2. the second layer of it is the regressor that predict how much the customer will purchase in the store.

The final forecast result is calculated by the classifier result multiply the regressor.

In order to generalize the prediction results, we train the model 10 times with different bagging starting seeds and feature starting seeds to ensure the randomness of the models and use the models to predict the final results.
